# BDELPHIN's desktop env. dotfiles repo

This repository contain my DotFiles (config files, starting with a .)
I'm using i3-gaps Window Manager.

I will update this repo slowly, I'm currently quite busy.

## added:
i3-gaps vindow manager config file. see in i3-gaps folder.

## install script: (coming real soon)
install.sh will backup existing dotfiles on your machine, and then copy mine in place and reload everything.
